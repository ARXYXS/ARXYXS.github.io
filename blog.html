                    <h3>Lecture 1: Web Dev 101</h3>
                        <p>In today's class I learned various terminology used in web development, as well as the difference between backend and frontend web development</p>
                        <p>I am most interested in learning more about VR andcreating 3D assets for interactive websites</p>

                    <h3>Lecture 2: Intro to accessible design and CSS webstyling</h3>
                        <p>For todays class, we were introduced to external CSS and the Figma to VS code pathway. I had heard of Figma being used to create prototypes for web design before but I had yet to use Figma for that purpose (honestly I really only used it as a reference/moodboard).</p>

                    <h3>Lecture 3: Intro to accessible design and CSS webstyling</h3>
                        <p>Today we were introduced to what preproduction workflow for interactive media may look like and how we can use elements of animation preproduction for interactive media. Prior to this class, I had only taken a preproduction animation course in preparation for my MRP. I had not considered that elements such as storyboards may be used to inform production of websites and other applications outside of the animation/film sphere. </p>

                    <h3>Lecture 4: PreVis for Non-linear Media</h3>
                        <p>Previsualization for non-linear media, as expected, is a lot more complicated than previs for non-linear media. Many preproduction step are less like steps and more like a circle of iterations at testing that (hopefully) get you closer to a working prototype of whatever you are developing. Storyboards and wireframes are especially different for non-linear media due to the interactivity and non-linearity aspects of the medium, and can take on a variety of different forms depending on what you want to visualize, the media in which it will be presented, and the team you are ultimately working with.</p>

                    <h3>Lecture 5: Scrolly-telling</h3>
                        <p>Our media lab this class was quite interesting, I enjoyed looking through scrolly-telling websites as I have little experience with scrolly-telling websites in the past. I learned what mouse-jacking/cursor-jacking was and  how it could make a scrolly-teller hard to navigate.  </p>
