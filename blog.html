                        <p>In today's class I learned various terminology used in web development, as well as the difference between backend and frontend web development</p>
                        <p>I am most interested in learning more about VR andcreating 3D assets for interactive websites</p>

                    <h3>Lecture 2: Intro to accessible design and CSS webstyling</h3>
                        <p>For todays class, we were introduced to external CSS and the Figma to VS code pathway. I had heard of Figma being used to create prototypes for web design before but I had yet to use Figma for that purpose (honestly I really only used it as a reference/moodboard).</p>

                    <h3>Lecture 3: Intro to accessible design and CSS webstyling</h3>
                        <p>Today we were introduced to what preproduction workflow for interactive media may look like and how we can use elements of animation preproduction for interactive media. Prior to this class, I had only taken a preproduction animation course in preparation for my MRP. I had not considered that elements such as storyboards may be used to inform production of websites and other applications outside of the animation/film sphere. </p>

                    <h3>Lecture 4: PreVis for Non-linear Media</h3>
                        <p>Previsualization for non-linear media, as expected, is a lot more complicated than previs for non-linear media. Many preproduction step are less like steps and more like a circle of iterations at testing that (hopefully) get you closer to a working prototype of whatever you are developing. Storyboards and wireframes are especially different for non-linear media due to the interactivity and non-linearity aspects of the medium, and can take on a variety of different forms depending on what you want to visualize, the media in which it will be presented, and the team you are ultimately working with.</p>

                    <h3>Lecture 5: Scrolly-telling</h3>
                        <p>Our media lab this class was quite interesting, I enjoyed looking through scrolly-telling websites as I have little experience with scrolly-telling websites in the past. I learned what mouse-jacking/cursor-jacking was and  how it could make a scrolly-teller hard to navigate.  </p>

                    <h3>Lecture 8: Optimizing 3D Assets for Real-time Rendering</h3>
                        <p>For this week's lecture, we learned about the various ways we optimize 3D models for use in real-time rendering. I learned a lot about how modellers consider the use of textures, polygon count, and resource calls in the creation of their 3D assets. I knew a bit about optimizing for the use in games that used 3D assets but learned a lot more about the developers side of things as someone who really only used these assets beforehand, rather than create them. In terms of my groups assets, I believe we made the right decision in deciding to create low-poly assets with minimal textures and flat colours. Here's an example of an embedded 3D asset from my earlier assignment in BMC that focused on visualizing waste clothing exports, also known as "mitumba", which are exported and sold to lower income countries at the cost of the importers.</p>
