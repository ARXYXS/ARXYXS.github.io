                    <h3>Week 1: February 3-7</h3>
                        <p>As the project lead for our group project, I spent most of the past week organizing the draft design document and consolidating my assigned section of research to bring to our group meeting on Thursday. Early on in our project planning, I had volunteered to organize the mood board, stylesheet and UI design elements for the design document before I had volunteered as team lead. I figured I wouldn’t be as busy doing a few admin tasks so taking on the UI design and stylesheet wouldn’t be too much on my plate. 
                            This week, everyone was tasked in bringing their slice of content research that they were assigned as well as pitching their general idea of how we may go about creating the AR project. The meeting went as planned and almost everyone was present with their research and ideas, all of which were very comprehensive and in-depth! I had pitched to create a simple sloped 3D printed hexagonal environment with “divots” to place “effector tokens” on that would have scannable images pasted on. It was suggested that the main piece may have to be flat to best accommodate the AR projection, so we went with a simpler flat hexagonal piece. A member of our group, Max, was unable to contribute to the meeting, so I reassigned them to help complete a different section of the project as to accommodate for their absence. I am working on a more efficient method to check in with the rest of the group. So far, we’ve been using our discord chat to keep in contact and put up drafts for feedback and this has been going well so far. I have implemented preliminary deadlines for drafts to ensure that everyone has feedback they can work off and so far, most of our group members have been able to reach these deadlines. 
                            After meeting on Thursday, we agreed to meet with Alex on Friday to go over a few of the ideas we had pitched as a group. I now feel as though we have a strong foundation in which we may begin developing the application. My challenge now is to figure out how best to assist the rest of the team as I am not directly involved in much of the development/production. I have assigned myself the responsibility of putting together clips from the development team for the development walkthrough as well as putting together the design document, final presentation, and maintaining contact with Alex as my primary duties. I’ll also try to contribute sketches and feedback notes throughout the production process to further involve myself in the production process. I am disappointed to an extent; I had joined this group to lend myself as a 3D production artist and a I have ended up doing administrative tasks instead as a group lead. I do feel equipped to be a project lead, so I believe this is the best way I can contribute to our project, especially since there are quite a few group members. Here’s a few of my sketches from this week:

                    <h3>Week 2: February 10-14</h3>
                        <p> For week 2 as project lead, I began the week by reviewing the meeting minutes from the team meeting I had been unable to attend and checked with my group members on the previsualization components they had been assigned. I continued to refine and contribute to the introductory and design sections and added any finished drafts to the main document. A few of the drafts I had updated the design document with needed to be revised so I held off updating these sections. I reminded my group members to contribute any draft sections they were responsible for and to update any revised documents on the main document by the end of the day on February 13th as to allow myself some time to look over the final document and proof-read the draft for submission. 
                            The day before the submission, I held a brief update meeting with a few of my group members to update each other on the status of each of the drafts and the timeline leading up to the final submission the day after. The morning of the submission I confirmed with my group members that I would be submitting the final document at noon and consolidated any edits to the draft document. 
                            Additionally, I planned for a quick asynchronous check-in with my group members sometime mid-way through the reading week just to reach out to see if there were any touch points, we could discuss or if another meeting would be necessary to consolidate any knowledge before beginning production.  
                         </p>

                    <h3>Week 3: February 17-21</h3>
                        <p>For week 3 as project lead, I began formatting the After Effects files for the developers walkthrough demo video and created a document for the final presentation. I hadn’t been able to work on much throughout the reading week but I was able to check-in with my group members mid week to touch-base on how everything was going with the project. We planned to meet more formally on Tuesday during class to check-in on production after the reading week and make sure that everyone has what they need to continue to work on the project. 
                            Around the end of the reading week, Jeah was able to show us a sneak-peak of the app so far and it appears to be functioning quite well so far! I am very excited for how the rest of the project will develop and am looking forward to further contributing to the documentation and project scheduling. 
                            Additionally, I spent some of the reading week reading up on Unity and familiarizing myself with a few of the aspects to consider during the development process. I also referred o the detailed developer notes that Jeah provided to better equip myself with the knowledge to help with the dev process as needed. 
                        </p>

                    <h3>Week 4: February 24-28</h3>
                        <p>
                            Early this week, a few of us had a meeting with Alex where we discussed the design document and our progress for our project. He mentioned that the design document was very detailed and well done but we may have our app development stage go past the deadline we had placed, which we should be ready for. We agreed the same day to hold another meeting between us group members to confirm final wireframes and begin production on the assets required of the project, and we were all able to meet on Thursday morning before our class. I took meeting notes and re-assessed the production timeline after a few of our group members took a break from working on the project during the reading week and had not started production. We agreed to set the deadline for assets to Saturday and the deadline for the minigame assets for the following week. 
                            During the meeting, we had a lot of discussion over the complexity of the project and the educational value it brings. I suggested only focussing on the mangrove and fishing modules, and it was suggested by Max that we should have the mangrove be more educational by adding different techniques to the mangrove planting. This had not been previously discussed but we agreed that if they would be animating and exporting this to AE then it would be doable. When deciding how the assets would be produced, I suggested that Naomi take on most of the responsibility for the mangrove assets, and since Yu-wen had existing models for the coral reefs, she would be the one to take on the fishing module assets. 
                            I am continuing to check-in with our discord and ensure that we are kept on track for the due date in March. Most of my activity for the project production so far has been administrative, and I anticipate having more work around mid-March as things become more concrete. As part of my administrative duties this week, I have taken meeting notes, coordinated the meeting agenda, added and organized a few additional asset folders on the Google Drive, and have updated the production timeline to reflect the changes we agreed upon last Thursday. 
                            I am worried I will not have enough time to create a demo video for the project if the development of the app is not finished in time there to be a sample demo video and enough time at the end for me to compile it into a demo. If anything, we could have a live demo, but this would require a bit more consideration as to how we could present this in class, technology wise. 
                        </p>  
                        
                    <h3>Week 4: February 24-28</h3>
                        <p>
                            This week I scheduled a group meeting after class on Tuesday to discuss any updates on the project in addition to our updates on discord. We discussed a few questions to bring up with Alex during our meeting and agreed to move forward with our initial production schedule. This way, we can give Jeah enough time to test and refine the final application and have the demo videos completed for the week of the submission. It was proposed by Max that they just create the 2D assets for the application and leave the coding and animation to Jeah, but I suggested creating compiling the assets in a series of PNG sequences in after effects to include this in the final app/demo video if Jeah did not have enough time to animate and code the minigame component, to which Jeah agreed. 
                            In our meeting with Alex, we shared progress on the asset development of our production and confirmed the due date would be moved to the following week. After our meeting, we had a 3D printing demo with Dave on Thursday where we were able to ask questions about our projected project goals to see if it would be feasible. 
                            For my section of the project I vectorized the logo we will be using for the project and added it to the shared GDrive folder. Additionally, I volunteered to design the icons we would be using to train or AR application to recognize, and vectorized the UI buttons I designed in the previous production stages so that they would be ready to be placed in app. 
                            I continued formatting the demo video After Effects file by adding in the logo and dividing off the sections of the video for better organization. I provided feedback on the discord for the asset production throughout the week and ensured the UI stylesheet was followed.
