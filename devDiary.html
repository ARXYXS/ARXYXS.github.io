                    <h3>Week 1: February 3-7</h3>
                        <p>As the project lead for our group project, I spent most of the past week organizing the draft design document and consolidating my assigned section of research to bring to our group meeting on Thursday. Early on in our project planning, I had volunteered to organize the mood board, stylesheet and UI design elements for the design document before I had volunteered as team lead. I figured I wouldn’t be as busy doing a few admin tasks so taking on the UI design and stylesheet wouldn’t be too much on my plate. 
                            This week, everyone was tasked in bringing their slice of content research that they were assigned as well as pitching their general idea of how we may go about creating the AR project. The meeting went as planned and almost everyone was present with their research and ideas, all of which were very comprehensive and in-depth! I had pitched to create a simple sloped 3D printed hexagonal environment with “divots” to place “effector tokens” on that would have scannable images pasted on. It was suggested that the main piece may have to be flat to best accommodate the AR projection, so we went with a simpler flat hexagonal piece. A member of our group, Max, was unable to contribute to the meeting, so I reassigned them to help complete a different section of the project as to accommodate for their absence. I am working on a more efficient method to check in with the rest of the group. So far, we’ve been using our discord chat to keep in contact and put up drafts for feedback and this has been going well so far. I have implemented preliminary deadlines for drafts to ensure that everyone has feedback they can work off and so far, most of our group members have been able to reach these deadlines. 
                            After meeting on Thursday, we agreed to meet with Alex on Friday to go over a few of the ideas we had pitched as a group. I now feel as though we have a strong foundation in which we may begin developing the application. My challenge now is to figure out how best to assist the rest of the team as I am not directly involved in much of the development/production. I have assigned myself the responsibility of putting together clips from the development team for the development walkthrough as well as putting together the design document, final presentation, and maintaining contact with Alex as my primary duties. I’ll also try to contribute sketches and feedback notes throughout the production process to further involve myself in the production process. I am disappointed to an extent; I had joined this group to lend myself as a 3D production artist and a I have ended up doing administrative tasks instead as a group lead. I do feel equipped to be a project lead, so I believe this is the best way I can contribute to our project, especially since there are quite a few group members. Here’s a few of my sketches from this week:
