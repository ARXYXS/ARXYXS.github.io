        <h2>MRP Description: The Importance of Timing When Treating Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury</h2>
            <p>The purpose of my MRP is to create an animation depicting the importance of timely assessment and care for patients suffering from traumatic spinal cord injuries. If treated within 24 hours following injury, patients are more likely to have greater motor and sensory outcomes than those treated after the 24-hour window.</p>
